It includes functionalities for molecular visualization, descriptor calculation, and interaction with an MCP server.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Molecular Visualization**: Generate images of molecules using RDKit.\n- **Descriptor Calculation**: Compute molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, and more.\n- **MCP Server Integration**: Communicate with an MCP server for advanced chemical informatics tasks.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `mcp_rdkit/`\n  - `__main__.py`: Entry point for the application. It initializes the MCP server and runs it in \"stdio\" mode.\n  - `rdkit_helper.py`: Contains helper functions for RDKit operations, including:\n    - Converting PIL images to base64.\n    - Interfacing with the MCP server.\n    - Utilizing RDKit for chemical computations.\n\n\n\n- `setup.py`: Configuration for packaging and distribution.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8 or higher\n- RDKit library\n- MCP framework\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install the package using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install mcp-rdkit\n   ```\n\n2. Run the application:\n   ```bash\n   python -m mcp_rdkit\n   ```\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can integrate this directly into Claude App:\n\n![Demo 1](uploads/image.png)\n![Demo 2](uploads/image%20(1).png)\n![Demo 3](uploads/image%20(2).png)\n\n\n## Usage\n\n- **Run the MCP server**:\n  The application starts an MCP server that can process chemical informatics tasks.\n\n- **Generate molecular images**:\n  Use the RDKit helper functions to visualize molecules.\n\n- **Calculate descriptors**:\n  Leverage RDKit's descriptor calculation tools for chemical analysis.\n\n## MCP Configuration Example\n\nTo use the RDKit server with MCP, add the following configuration to your `mcp` config file:\n\n```json\n\"rdkit-server\": {\n  \"type\": \"stdio\",\n  \"command\": \"python\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-m\",\n    \"mcp_rdkit\"\n  ]\n}\n```", "iconUrl": "https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/github.com.ico", "verified": false, "useCount": 0, "remote": true, "createdAt": "2025-05-14T23:35:16.206Z", "homepage": "https://smithery.ai/server/@s20ss/mcp_rdkit"}

It transforms the traditional \"prompt-then-code-dump\" workflow into a systematic, specification-driven process where specifications don't serve code—code serves specifications.\n\n🌟 The Power Inversion: A New Development Paradigm\nFor decades, code has been king. Specifications were scaffolding—built, used, then discarded once \"real work\" began. PRDs guided development, design docs informed implementation, but these were always subordinate to code. Code was truth. Everything else was, at best, good intentions.\n\nSpec-Driven Development inverts this power structure: \n\nSpecifications Generate Code: The PRD isn't a guide—it's the source that produces implementation\nExecutable Specifications: Precise, complete specs that eliminate the gap between intent and implementation\nCode as Expression: Code becomes the specification's expression in a particular language/framework\nLiving Documentation: Maintain software by evolving specifications, not manually updating code\nThis transformation is possible because AI can understand complex specifications and implement them systematically. But raw AI generation without structure produces chaos. DinCoder provides that structure through GitHub's proven Spec Kit methodology.
