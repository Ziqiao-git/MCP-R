  "description": "PentestThinkingMCP: AI-Driven Multi-Stage Penetration Testing Framework\nPart of the LIMA Research Project ‚Äì Accepted at IEEE FMLDS 2025\nDeveloped by Mohammad Ibrahim Saleem, Cybersecurity Researcher, University of Houston\n\nPentestThinkingMCP is an AI-powered MCP (Model Context Protocol) server developed as part of the LIMA research project. This work was recently accepted as a full paper at IEEE FMLDS 2025. The server automates and optimizes penetration testing workflows by planning complex, multi-stage attack paths using advanced reasoning methods such as Beam Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) enabling efficient, adaptive, and intelligent exploitation in both real-world and CTF environments.\n\nüöÄ Core Features\n\nAI-generated step-by-step attack recommendations\n\nContext-aware tool suggestions aligned with vulnerabilities\n\nCritical path analysis to maximize impact with minimal noise\n\nAutonomous attack chain simulation with dynamic environment modeling\n\nThis framework helps red teamers, researchers, and ethical hackers adopt a strategic, AI-assisted offensive mindset, moving beyond traditional one-off exploits.\n\nüì¢ Citation Request\nIf you use PentestThinkingMCP in your research, academic work, or projects, please cite our paper:\n‚ÄúLIMA: Leveraging Large Language Models and MCP Servers for Initial Machine Access‚Äù ‚Äì IEEE FMLDS 2025.",
